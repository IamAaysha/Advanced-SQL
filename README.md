# SQL Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates key SQL techniques for data analysis, including data wrangling, filtering, joins, and advanced window functions. It showcases how SQL can be used to extract meaningful insights from raw data efficiently.

## Features
- **Basic Statistics:** Computes fundamental metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and data distribution insights.
- **Data Wrangling:** Cleans and transforms raw data for easier analysis.
- **Filtering and Aggregation:** Extracts relevant subsets of data using `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses.
- **Joins and Relationships:** Utilizes `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Window Functions:** Implements ranking, running totals, and moving averages using `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `SUM() OVER()`.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
- Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

## How to Use
1. Run the SQL scripts in a compatible SQL environment.
2. Modify queries as needed to adapt to different datasets.
3. Analyze results for data-driven decision-making.

## Potential Applications
- Business intelligence reporting
- Performance analytics
- Customer segmentation
- Trend analysis

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced SQL-driven data analytics workflows.
